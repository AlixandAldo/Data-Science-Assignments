# Data-Science-Assignments
Repository for the Data Science learning track to host assignments.

Find powerpoints and helpful resources in the course_material folder of this repo!
You'll need to clone the repo to see most of them. 

<br>Find a great quick python reference here: https://www.w3schools.com/python/

### Homework tips
*Think ‘process’ not ‘product’. The goal is to learn. The goal is not to hand in a perfect assignment.*

*Skim your homework assignment BEFORE you do the readings. It will help focus your attention!*

*SQR3: Scan, Question, Read, Recall, Review!!!!*

# Week 1 - Introductions and Python
## In Class Assignment due Friday, March 5, 2021 @ 8pm
1. Finish any installs not completed in class. 
2. Skim the `Survival Guide` presentation. We will discuss this in more detail throughout first 8 wks.
3. Create a complete schedule for yourself and include EVERYTHING you can (Work, commute, dinner, any obligations and study time). Highlight times you will be studying. 
    - Head over to this [spreadsheet](https://github.com/LaunchCoderGirlSTL/Data-Science-Assignments/blob/master/course_material/Schedule_template) and see the example schedule on the first tab. 
    - Create a tab with `your initials`.
    - Copy the `template` sheet into your tab. 
    - Fill out an accurate schedule for yourself. 
        - This does not need to be updated as your schedule changes. 
	- Please submit the spreadsheet in Canvas. You can just have your schedule on there, without the template and others.
