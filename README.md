# Data-Science-Assignments
Repository for the Data Science learning track to host assignments.

Find powerpoints and helpful resources in the course_material folder of this repo!
You'll need to clone the repo to see most of them. 

<br>Find a great quick python reference here: https://www.w3schools.com/python/

### Homework tips
*Think ‘process’ not ‘product’. The goal is to learn. The goal is not to hand in a perfect assignment.*

*Skim your homework assignment BEFORE you do the readings. It will help focus your attention!*

*SQR3: Scan, Question, Read, Recall, Review!!!!*

    - Working with classes can be challenging. Focus your attention on:
        1. Creating classes.
        2. Adding attributes. 
        3. Creating class methods. (methods that operate on the entire class)
        4. Creating instance methods. (methods that act only on the instance)
        5. Creating objects from classes. (`foo = MyClass(attr1, attr2`)
    - Focus less (but be aware) of:
        1. Inheritance

    - Read this [introduction to classes.](http://introtopython.org/classes.html) (Don't worry about the exercises or any notes about Python 2.7.)
    - Read [this](https://www.learnpython.org/en/Classes_and_Objects) and complete the exercise at the end. You do not need to submit these, but they will prepare you for the homework.
    - Read this [Python's Methods Demystified](https://realpython.com/instance-class-and-static-methods-demystified/)
4. [Intro to Git](https://learn.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-git) Please complete 3
