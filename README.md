# Data-Science-Assignments
Repository for the Data Science learning track to host assignments.

Find powerpoints and helpful resources in the course_material folder of this repo!
You'll need to clone the repo to see most of them. 

<br>Find a great quick python reference here: https://www.w3schools.com/python/

### Homework tips
*Think ‘process’ not ‘product’. The goal is to learn. The goal is not to hand in a perfect assignment.*

*Skim your homework assignment BEFORE you do the readings. It will help focus your attention!*

*SQR3: Scan, Question, Read, Recall, Review!!!!*

# Week 1 - Introductions and Python
## In Class Assignment due Friday, March 5, 2021 @ 8pm
1. Finish any installs not completed in class. 
2. Skim the `Survival Guide` presentation. We will discuss this in more detail throughout first 8 wks.
3. Create a complete schedule for yourself and include EVERYTHING you can (Work, commute, dinner, any obligations and study time). Highlight times you will be studying. 
    - Head over to this [spreadsheet](https://github.com/LaunchCoderGirlSTL/Data-Science-Assignments/blob/master/course_material/Schedule_template) and see the example schedule on the first tab. 
    - Create a tab with `your initials`.
    - Copy the `template` sheet into your tab. 
    - Fill out an accurate schedule for yourself. 
        - This does not need to be updated as your schedule changes. 
	- Please submit the spreadsheet in Canvas. You can just have your schedule on there, without the template and others.

## Homework due Wednesday, March 17, 2021 @ 5:30pm
### Readings/Videos/DataCamp
1. Loops
    - In DataCamp, go to Intermediate Python, Chapter 4: Loops (Click [here](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/intermediate-python/loops?ex=1) to start)
    - Complete "While Loop" through "Loop over list of lists"
 
2. Functions
    - Read this [introduction to functions.](http://introtopython.org/introducing_functions.html) (Don't worry about the exercises)

    - Working with classes can be challenging. Focus your attention on:
        1. Creating classes.
        2. Adding attributes. 
        3. Creating class methods. (methods that operate on the entire class)
        4. Creating instance methods. (methods that act only on the instance)
        5. Creating objects from classes. (`foo = MyClass(attr1, attr2`)
    - Focus less (but be aware) of:
        1. Inheritance

    - Read this [introduction to classes.](http://introtopython.org/classes.html) (Don't worry about the exercises or any notes about Python 2.7.)
    - Read [this](https://www.learnpython.org/en/Classes_and_Objects) and complete the exercise at the end.
